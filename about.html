            Interior was founded in 2002 with the ambition to create contemporary furniture with an eye for modern
            living and sophisticated industrial manufacturing. That remains our ambition today. Through our commitment
            to the design and production of furniture and accessories with an international appeal we strive to make
            good design accessible to the largest possible audience.
            <br><br>
            We are inspired by the stable structures of architecture and the dynamics of fashion, which we seek to
            combine in durable quality products that provide added value for the user. Interior continued vision is to
            create straightforward, functional and aesthetic design in cooperation with some of the worldâ€™s most
            talented, curious and courageous designers.
